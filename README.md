# Graph Databases

## A Practical Introduction

#### Brought to you by the good folks at [XN Logic](http://xnlogic.com). 

In this workshop we take a deep dive into the world of graph databases.

We start with a friendly introduction to graphs & graph databases, and survey the current state of the ecosystem.

We continue by introducing [Pacer](https://github.com/xnlogic/pacer), a graph-egnostic, open-source library that provides
 1. Fast & expressive graph traversal
 2. Extensible data modeling

After introducing the tools, we move on to the main part of the workshop - A series of hands-on, in-depth tutorials that will teach you everything you need to know in order to start developing graph-backed applications.

We wrap up the day with a demo of a fully-functional web application that uses [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and Pacer.
