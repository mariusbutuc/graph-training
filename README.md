### Exercises

See the [`exercises` folder](exercises) of this repo.

The exercises come with basic unit tests that let you check that your code is correct.     
In order to run these tests, you will need to install [MiniTest](https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest/versions/5.7.0) by running

```
gem install minitest
```

After installing MinTest, you can run the tests as follows:

```
cd exercises
# Run the tests for exercise 1
ruby ex1-test.rb
```
